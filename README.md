# ROS2-Publisher-Subscriber
This ROS2 project consists of two nodes: a publisher node and a subscriber node. The publisher node sends the message "hello" on the topic '/node1', while the subscriber node listens to the same topic and prints the incoming data to the terminal. This simple demonstration showcases the basic communication between nodes in a ROS2 environment.
